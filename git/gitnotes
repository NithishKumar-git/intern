Git is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other’s changes. Here are some key features:

Version Control: Git keeps a history of changes, enabling you to revert to previous versions if needed.

Branching: You can create branches to work on new features or fixes in isolation, then merge them back into the main codebase.

Collaboration: Multiple developers can collaborate on the same project, and Git helps manage changes made by different contributors.

Distributed: Each developer has a complete copy of the repository, including its history, making it easy to work offline.

Efficiency: Git is designed to handle large projects efficiently and provides tools for comparing changes and resolving conflicts.

HOW TO PULL ON GITHUB

Open Terminal or Command Prompt:

On Windows, you can use Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Git Bash.
On macOS or Linux, use the Terminal.
Navigate to Your Repository: Use the cd command to change directories to the local repository. For example:

bash
Copy code
cd path/to/your/repo
Check the Current Branch (optional): You can check which branch you're on with:

bash
Copy code
git branch
Pull Changes: To pull the latest changes from the remote repository, run:

bash
Copy code
git pull origin main
Replace main with the name of the branch you want to pull if it's different (e.g., master, develop, etc.).

Resolve Any Conflicts (if necessary): If there are conflicts, Git will notify you. You’ll need to manually resolve them before completing the pull. After resolving, use:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
Verify Changes: After pulling, you can check the status or view the latest changes:

bash
Copy code
git status
git
    


    HOW TO PUSH ON GITHUB


    Steps to Push Changes
Open Terminal or Command Prompt:

Use Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Git Bash on Windows.
Use Terminal on macOS or Linux.
Navigate to Your Repository: Change directories to your local repository:

bash
Copy code
cd path/to/your/repo
Check the Current Branch (optional): You can check which branch you’re on:

bash
Copy code
git branch
Stage Your Changes: Add the files you want to commit. To stage all changes, use:

bash
Copy code
git add .
Or stage specific files:

bash
Copy code
git add filename
Commit Your Changes: Create a commit with a message describing your changes:

bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
Pull Latest Changes (optional but recommended): To ensure your local branch is up to date with the remote branch, you can pull the latest changes:

bash
Copy code
git pull origin main
Replace main with the appropriate branch name if necessary. Resolve any merge conflicts if prompted.

Push Changes to GitHub: Finally, push your changes to the remote repository:

bash
Copy code
git push origin main
Again, replace main with the name of your branch if it's different.

Verify on GitHub: You can check the GitHub repository in your web browser to confirm that your changes have been pushed.
